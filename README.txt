# data_science_programs



Overview
--------
This rmarkdown document "myMap.RMD" produces a map with various data science masters in France. This map was originally created for an assignment on Coursera, however I thought making it public might help other data science enthusiasts find a school that fits their needs. Please help contribute to this map by adding other schools to the map, useful information about each program (e.g. cost, length, rankings, etc.) or even developping new interactive tools (alumni network showing professions to showcase possible career paths).
